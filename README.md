One of my longterm goals is to master python methodology for data extraction, manipulation and presentation.

In a world where my university did not value matlab. I tought myself pythons equivallent (numpy/pandas/scipy/matplotlib) and I have 0 regrets. This adaptation to data science using a true programming language is powerful.
